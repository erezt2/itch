# itch
A visual programming language for kids that supports multiplayer (using WebRTC)

This program is mostly intuitive, but some features can be specific or misleading (functions and networks are strong offenders).
There probably some minor\ rare bugs left in the program.

Very simple 'catch' game example can be found in saves/catchExample.json


Sorry in advance for the lack of modularity if you are looking through the code, I had to finish this whole project due april 30th so I cut some corners.

THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT RESISTANT TO ATTACKS! do NOT load any save files from untrusted sources. The breach is very easy to fix but its annoying to fix so i won't do it for now.
