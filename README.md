# itch
A visual programming language for kids that supports multiplayer (using WebRTC)

This program is mostly intuitive, but some features can be misleading.
There probably some minor\ rare bugs left in the program.


Sorry in advance for the lack of modularity if you are looking through the code, I had to finish this whole project due april 30th so I cut some corners.
